Request - printBoard make seperate method to return X or O (removes redundant code)
Request - nextMove() retry message

Request[Done] - isplayerone in printMoveRequest -> isPlayerOne
Request[Done] - Initialize turnCount datafield
Request[Done] - nextMove() should not have the check if a field is beetween 1-9, should be in validateMove
	moved input size validation to validateMove
	
	

Bug - Player Turn request wrong way around.

Bug[Fixed] - Draw State not in checkGameState()
	Added else if to check for turnCount == 8
Bug[Fixed] - validateMove(), int player is not used
	Removed parameter
Bug[Fixed] - Invalid move message is sent, but field gets overwritten anyways
	Changed validateMove method to be true by default and set to false if condition is met
